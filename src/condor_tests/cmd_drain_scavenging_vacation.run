my $testName = 'cmd_drain_scavenging_vacation';
my $testDescription = 'Test scavenging with an original job that ages out of retirement.';

#
# This test validates the new scavenging functionality of the drain state.
# In particular, that:
#
#	* the new START expression is advertised;
#	* the new START expression is effective, that is, some jobs will start
#	  and others will not while the startd is draining;
#	* the condor_drain -start option is working;
#	* that when the last of the 'original' jobs exit, all the scavengers
#	  are preempted
#	* after the startd is drained, cancelling the draining results
#	  in effective change to the START expression;
#	* AcceptedWhileDraining is correct.
#
# It does NOT, but should, validate the following:
#	* the condor_defrag daemon's knob to set the START expression;
#	* that when the last of the 'original' jobs exit, the startd sets
#	  MaxJobRetirementTime, but not MaxMachineVacateTime to 0;
#	* that when the last of the 'original' jobs exit, the startd invalidates
#	  all claim IDs;
#	* that when the draining is cancelled, MaxJobRetirementTime returns
#	  to original value (both advertised and effective);
#	* that after the startd is drained, cancelling the draining results
#	  in the original START expression being advertised (and used).
#

#
# To do the validation, we submit five jobs (which have durations which should
# never matter): the first three don't mention MaxJobRetirementTime at all,
# the fourth sets it to zero, and the fifth to nonzero.  This is so that
# the fourth and fifth jobs will look start (or not start) only on the basis
# of the (recommended) START expression we use when we begin draining.
#
# After the first three jobs have started, we'll begin draining with a START
# expression of 'TARGET.IsInterruptible'.  Then we'll verify that
# the slots have all changed state & activity, and that the new START
# expression is being advertised.  Then we'll terminate two of the original
# jobs and call condor_reschedule.
#
# One and only one should match; we'll wait for it to actually start.  Then
# we'll verify the new slot's state & activity.  Then we wait for the last
# original job to be vacated for exceeding its max job retirement time.  Note
# that the scavenger job must have a retirement time exceeding that of the
# original job's to test this properly.  In the setup suggested by
# cmd_drain_scavenging, that will always be true (because the job must
# have an MJRT of 0), but in production (e.g., CHTC) that's not so.
#
# If run against an unpatched startd, this test will fail when the scavenger
# job unexpectedly succeeds (before the last original job is evicted).
