CONFIG job_dagman_job_held.config

# Disabled for now, since we've changed DAGMAN_MAX_JOB_HOLDS to reflect number
# of held procs at any instance, instead of number of hold events over the
# course of a job's lifetime. We should re-enable later once we've added
# functionality to support both.
# JOB A job_dagman_job_held-nodeA.cmd

# This is a parallel job.
JOB B job_dagman_job_held-nodeB.cmd
