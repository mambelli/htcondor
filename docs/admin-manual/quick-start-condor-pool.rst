Quick Start: Setting up an HTCondor Pool
========================================

In this Quick Start guide for setting up an HTCondor pool, we show how to setup
and configure a basic pool with three machines:

-   A **submit** machine, where users log in to submit their jobs
    (*condor-submit.mydomain.com*)

-   An **execute** machine, where the jobs actually run
    (*condor-execute.mydomain.com*)

-   A **central manager**, which matches submitted jobs to execute resources
    (*condor-cm.mydomain.com*)

We'll show how to install and configure this pool using the latest Stable
release of the HTCondor software on RHEL 7 / CentOS 7. For different operating
systems and more advanced options, please see the resources at the end of
this page.


Installing from the Repository
------------------------------

On each of the three machines, add the HTCondor repository to your system:

::

    $ wget https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-HTCondor
    $ sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-HTCondor
    $ cd /etc/yum.repos.d
    $ sudo wget https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/yum/repo.d/htcondor-stable-rhel7.repo

Now on each of the three machines, install HTCondor:

::

    $ sudo yum install condor


Cluster Configuration
---------------------

On all three machines, start by setting the address of the Central Manager, as
well as a firewall rule:

::

    $ echo "CONDOR_HOST = condor-cm.mydomain.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/condor/config.d/49-common
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9618/tcp --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Now we need to set machine-specific configuration.

Submit Machine
''''''''''''''

::

    $ echo "use ROLE: Submit" | sudo tee -a /etc/condor/config.d/51-role-submit

Execute Machine
'''''''''''''''

::

    $ echo "use ROLE: Execute" | sudo tee -a /etc/condor/config.d/51-role-exec

Central Manager Machine
'''''''''''''''''''''''

::

    $ echo "use ROLE: CentralManager" | sudo tee -a /etc/condor/config.d/51-role-cm
    $ echo "ALLOW_WRITE_COLLECTOR=\$(ALLOW_WRITE) condor-execute.mydomain.com condor-submit.mydomain.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/condor/config.d/51-role-cm


Start HTCondor
--------------

Once the above configuration is in place, we're ready to start our HTCondor
pool. On each of the three machines, run the following:

::

    $ sudo systemctl enable condor
    $ sudo systemctl start condor

We also need to add security configurations so the machines can authenticate
with each other. On each machine, create the file 
**/etc/condor/config.d/50-security** with the following contents:

::

    SEC_PASSWORD_FILE = /etc/condor/password.d/POOL 
    SEC_DAEMON_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED 
    SEC_DAEMON_INTEGRITY = REQUIRED
    SEC_DAEMON_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = PASSWORD
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_AUTHENTICATION = REQUIRED
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_INTEGRITY = REQUIRED
    SEC_NEGOTIATOR_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = PASSWORD
    SEC_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = FS, PASSWORD, KERBEROS, GSI
    ALLOW_DAEMON = condor_pool@*/condor*.mydomain.com, \ condor@*/$(IP_ADDRESS)
    ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = condor_pool@*/condor-cm.mydomain.com

Next, run:

::

    $ condor_store_cred add -c


All Done!
---------

At this point, your HTCondor pool should be up and running. You can test it
using the *condor_q* and *condor_status* commands, which should produce the
following output:

::

    $ condor_q

    -- Schedd: condor-submit : <192.168.15.5:9618?... @ 01/15/20 15:49:09

    Total for all users: 0 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
