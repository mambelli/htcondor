Synopsis
--------

**condor_transfer_data** [**-help | -version**]

**condor_transfer_data** [
**-pool** *centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]* |
**-name** *scheddname* ] | [**-addr** *"<a.b.c.d:port>"*]
*cluster... | cluster.process... | user...* |
**-constraint** *expression* ...

**condor_transfer_data** [
**-pool** *centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]* |
**-name** *scheddname* ] | [**-addr** *"<a.b.c.d:port>"*] **-all**

Description
-----------

*condor_transfer_data* causes HTCondor to transfer spooled data. It is
meant to be used in conjunction with the **-spool** option of
*condor_submit*, as in

::

    condor_submit -spool mysubmitfile

Submission of a job with the **-spool** option causes HTCondor to spool
all input files, the job event log, and any proxy across a connection to
the machine where the *condor_schedd* daemon is running. After spooling
these files, the machine from which the job is submitted may disconnect
from the network or modify its local copies of the spooled files.

When the job finishes, the job has ``JobStatus`` = 4, meaning that the
job has completed. The output of the job is spooled, and
*condor_transfer_data* retrieves the output of the completed job.
