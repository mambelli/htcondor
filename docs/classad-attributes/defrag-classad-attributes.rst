Defrag ClassAd Attributes
=========================

:index:`Defrag attributes<single: Defrag attributes; ClassAd>`
:index:`AvgDrainingBadput<single: AvgDrainingBadput; ClassAd Defrag attribute>`

``AvgDrainingBadput``:
    Fraction of time CPUs in the pool have spent on jobs that were
    killed during draining of the machine. This is calculated in each
    polling interval by looking at ``TotalMachineDrainingBadput``.
    Therefore, it treats evictions of jobs that do and do not produce
    checkpoints the same. When the *condor_startd* restarts, its
    counters start over from 0, so the average is only over the time
    since the daemons have been alive.
    :index:`AvgDrainingUnclaimedTime<single: AvgDrainingUnclaimedTime; ClassAd Defrag attribute>`

``AvgDrainingUnclaimedTime``:
    Fraction of time CPUs in the pool have spent unclaimed by a user
    during draining of the machine. This is calculated in each polling
    interval by looking at ``TotalMachineDrainingUnclaimedTime``. When
    the *condor_startd* restarts, its counters start over from 0, so
    the average is only over the time since the daemons have been alive.

    :index:`MonitorSelfTime<single: MonitorSelfTime; ClassAd Defrag attribute>`

``MonitorSelfTime``:
    The time, represented as the number of seconds elapsed since the
    Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970), at which this daemon last
    checked and set the attributes with names that begin with the string
    ``MonitorSelf``.
    :index:`MyAddress<single: MyAddress; ClassAd Defrag attribute>`

``MyAddress``:
